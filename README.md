By default, the screen resolution is set to 1920x1080, as well as the keyboard in Spanish. This can be changed by editing the .xinitrc file as shown in the video:<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Rs12xKhQua4" title="video">https://youtu.be/Rs12xKhQua4</a></p> Future versions will not bring this pre-configuration and must be done by the user.
Another thing to take into account, based on the experience from the tests carried out, is that Picom, which is activated by default with --experimental-backend, works fine on a virtual machine, but on real hardware it works better if it is not used - -experimental-backend. So it would be better to try and in any case you can change it by editing the .xinitr.
